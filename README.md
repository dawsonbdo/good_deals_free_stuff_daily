# Get daily emails with the best deals and free stuff
Uses Reddit's praw API to look over subreddits that contains deals and/or free stuff to redeem and sends an email daily reporting all this information for easy access.

Currently looks over r/deals, r/GameDeals, and r/eFreebies.

Python script is executed daily via cron on a Raspberry Pi 4.

Coming soon: A Google Form to add your email to the daily email listing and a Discord Webhook.
